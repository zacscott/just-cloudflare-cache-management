Flush the Cloudflare edge cache for posts/pages when they are updated, and more.

== Description ==

Automatically flushes the Cloudflare edge cache when a post or page is updated,
ensuring that changes made to posts are immediately reflected on your website. 

This plugin is designed to be smart and will only update URLs associated with the post, such as the post permalink 
and any category pages it appears on, without invalidating the entire site cache each time. With this 
plugin, you'll never have to worry about outdated content being served from the cache again.
